# Kieran Nolan - Innovator, Educator, and Bitcoin Enthusiast

## First Person

I'm Kieran Nolan, and I'm passionate about innovation, disruption, and lifelong learning. You can find me at [kdnolan.com](https://kdnolan.com), or you can reach out to me via NOSTR: [`npub1cyla8qgt9gv8y6ydv8s2prt89h8afc0sr2kaz64ryjmlpdrzxm4qwlh53q`](https://nosta.me/c13fd3810b2a1872688d61e0a08d672dcfd4e1f01aadd16aa324b7f0b46236ea). I'm actively involved in various educational and technological initiatives, including serving as the Learning Programs Director for the Digital Playhouse Foundation, where I'm dedicated to digital literacy projects such as [theschoolofbitcoin.com](https://theschoolofbitcoin.com). I also run a news platform based on the NOSTR protocol called BitcoinAggregated and host the #getoffzero podcast, which documents Bitcoin learning journeys. Notably, I've been teaching Bitcoin in schools since 2013, contributing to a transformative education approach. My career has been marked by this commitment to innovative teaching methods, from my time as an Educational Technologist at Wooranna Park Primary School, where I pioneered Victoria's first CoderDojo and Australia's first Immersive Education Club, to my role as "STEM Wizard" at Boneo Primary School. I've had the privilege of speaking at prestigious conferences worldwide and have been recognized in the education field, earning a place on the educator hotlist in both 2019 and 2020. My qualifications include a Teaching TAE40116 Certification, Google Apps for Education Certification, a Computer Science Degree, an Advanced Diploma in Cyber Security, and a Diploma in Information Technology. I'm also a Google Certified Photographer, and my projects include hackerspace, getoffzeropodcast, ₿itcoinaggregated, peninsula₿itcoin, and theschoolof₿itcoin. My journey in education and technology has been featured in media outlets such as The George Lucas Foundation, Bitcoin.com, The Age, and Australian Teacher Magazine, and I'm dedicated to pushing the boundaries of learning and technology.
