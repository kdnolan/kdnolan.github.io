# About Me (First Person)

I'm **Kieran Nolan**, passionate about innovation, disruption, and lifelong learning.  
You can find me at [kdnolan.com](https://kdnolan.com) or reach out via Nostr:  
[npub1cyla8qgt9gv8y6ydv8s2prt89h8afc0sr2kaz64ryjmlpdrzxm4qwlh53q](https://nosta.me/npub1cyla8qgt9gv8y6ydv8s2prt89h8afc0sr2kaz64ryjmlpdrzxm4qwlh53q).

I'm deeply involved in educational and technological initiatives, currently serving as the Learning Programs Director for the **Digital Playhouse Foundation** charity, where I focus on projects such as [consensus21.school](https://consensus21.school). I also lead an educational technology community on the Mornington Peninsula, promoting digital literacy, emerging technologies, and collaborative learning.

Since 2013, I've been teaching Bitcoin in schools, helping to drive transformative approaches to education. Throughout my career, I’ve championed innovative teaching methods — from pioneering Victoria's first **CoderDojo** and Australia's first **Immersive Education Club** as an Educational Technologist at Wooranna Park Primary School, to my creative role as "**STEM Wizard**" at Boneo Primary School.

At [Boneo Hackerspace](https://boneohackerspace.npub.pro/), which I created and run, students have:  
- Built a supercomputer from recycled parts  
- Constructed an arcade machine and designed their own games for it  
- Built and helped maintain a smart classroom mesh network  
- Run a Minecraft server where I’ve mapped the entire Fortinet cybersecurity curriculum  

The hackerspace also explores Bitcoin, decentralised technologies, eSports, and white hat hacking, making learning engaging and immersive.

I've had the privilege of speaking at major conferences worldwide and was honoured to be named on the educator hotlist in both 2019 and 2020. My work has been featured in outlets such as **The George Lucas Foundation**, **Bitcoin.com**, **The Age**, and **Australian Teacher Magazine**. You can also find a collection of my articles on GitHub:  
[github.com/kdnolan/kdnolan.github.io/tree/master/articles](https://github.com/kdnolan/kdnolan.github.io/tree/master/articles)

I remain dedicated to pushing the boundaries of learning and technology.
